Preprocess Data Upload: Oct-17-2021 (Bruce Zheng)
1. ID:182 Bodyfat 0 to 7.3
2. ID:42 Height 29.5 to 69.5
3. Create a WEIGHT_KG variable, WEIGHT_KG = 0.453592 * WEIGHT  # 1 pound = 0.453592 kg
4. Create a HEIGHT_M variable, HEIGHT_M = 0.0254 * HEIGHT  # 1 inch  =  0.0254 m


Building Models Uploaded: Oct-17-2021 (Yixuan Wang)
1. Build the full model with linear regression, return the estimated coefficients, stds, t-statistics, p-values, adjusted R-squared and RMSE.
2. Using 3-fold and cross-validation to find the curve of lambda and training and test score.
3. Build two Lasso regression models, return the estimated coefficients, stds, t-statistics, p-values, adjusted R-squared and RMSE.

Diagnostics Uploaded: Oct-18-2021 (Haishuo Chen)
1. model diagnostics on linear model assumptions and high leverage points.
2. Drop two high leverage points and improve the performance of our model.
3. Validate performance on test data.

Code Clean: Oct-18-2021 (Haishuo Chen)
1. two files: Diagnostics, full model and lasso
